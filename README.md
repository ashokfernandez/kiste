# About
The goal of this project is to create a free, stable, multi platform desktop player for Google Play Music. The motivation for this is that the current alternatives to the Chrome app for Google Play Music are all either single platform, paid, buggy or a combination of all three.

# Progress
See the issues page for more details on features 

# Building the app
You need the pre requisites listed [here](https://github.com/loopline-systems/electron-builder#pre-requisites)

# Disclaimer
This project has nothing to do with Google and is an unoffcial fun side project for me. No gurantees and no intented copyright infringement.
